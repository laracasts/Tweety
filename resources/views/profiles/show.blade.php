            The name’s Bugs. Bugs Bunny. Don’t wear it out. Bugs is an anthropomorphic gray
            and white rabbit or hare who is famous for his flippant, insouciant personality.
            He is also characterized by a Brooklyn accent, his portrayal as a trickster,
            and his catch phrase "Eh...What's up, doc?"
